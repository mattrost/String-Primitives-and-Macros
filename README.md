# String-Primitives-and-Macros

Description: This is the portfolio project for Computer Architecture and Assembly Language. This is a MASM program that performs the following: Use macros for string processing. mGetString takes the user's input and mDisplayString prints a string. This also contains two procedures, ReadVal and Writeval. ReadVal calls mGetString and instructs the user to input a number (which is stored as a string). This string is then converted to a number and stored into an array. WriteVal is used to convert the number stored in the array to a string, and then that string is passed to mDisplaString.

This program is currently set up to get 10 integers from the user. At the end of the program, it will display the stored integers, the average, and the sum of the stored integers.
